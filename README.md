# Getting Started

You are only allowed to use react, react-dom and your choice of any development-environment specific libraries (testing tools, babel, etc). 

In this project all other 3rd-party libraries are forbidden (Redux, lodash, jQuery, axios, bootstrap, etc).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Custom eslint is removed from this project.

### `yarn start`
